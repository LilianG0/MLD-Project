# MLD-Project

This repository contains the routines used to obtain the plots in the report [_Mixed layer depth variability in the North Atlantic Ocean in the ARMOR 3D dataset_](https://www.overleaf.com/read/rmjfbdbbrsbf) and one implemetation of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) over the Gulf Stream, as an example. 

Along with these routines, the repository also contains one bash file with NCO commands that may be useful to pre-process the original datasets. This may include the concatenating of several data files in one or the change of the reference latitude. Finally, the repository also has 5 different anmations of the mixed layer dept + sea surface heigth, and the PCA output.
